EXAMPLES
       For a more extensive set of examples, documented more fully, see the [4m00QUICKSTART[24m file of the [4mlsof[24m distribution.

       To list all open files, use:

              lsof

       To list all open Internet, x.25 (HP-UX), and UNIX domain files, use:

              lsof -i -U

       To list all open IPv4 network files in use by the process whose PID is 1234, use:

              lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234

       Presuming the UNIX dialect supports IPv6, to list only open IPv6 network files, use:

              lsof -i 6

       To list all files using any protocol on ports 513, 514, or 515 of host wonderland.cc.purdue.edu, use:

              lsof -i @wonderland.cc.purdue.edu:513-515

       To list all files using any protocol on any port of mace.cc.purdue.edu (cc.purdue.edu is the default domain), use:

              lsof -i @mace

       To list all open files for login name ``abe'', or user ID 1234, or process 456, or process 123, or process 789, use:

              lsof -p 456,123,789 -u 1234,abe

       To list all open files on device /dev/hd4, use:

              lsof /dev/hd4

       To find the process that has /u/abe/foo open, use:

              lsof /u/abe/foo

       To send a SIGHUP to the processes that have /u/abe/bar open, use:

              kill -HUP `lsof -t /u/abe/bar`

       To find any open file, including an open UNIX domain socket file, with the name [4m/dev/log[24m, use:

              lsof /dev/log

       To  find  processes with open files on the NFS file system named [4m/nfs/mount/point[24m whose server is inaccessible, and presuming
       your mount table supplies the device number for [4m/nfs/mount/point[24m, use:

              lsof -b /nfs/mount/point

       To do the preceding search with warning messages suppressed, use:

              lsof -bw /nfs/mount/point

       To ignore the device cache file, use:

              lsof -Di

       To obtain PID and command name field output for each process, file descriptor, file device number, and file inode number  for
       each file of each process, use:

              lsof -FpcfDi

       To  list  the  files  at descriptors 1 and 3 of every process running the [4mlsof[24m command for login ID ``abe'' every 10 seconds,
       use:

              lsof -c lsof -a -d 1 -d 3 -u abe -r10

       To list the current working directory of processes running a command that is exactly four characters long and has an  'o'  or
       'O' in character three, use this regular expression form of the [1m-c [4m[22mc[24m option:

              lsof -c /^..o.$/i -a -d cwd

       To find an IP version 4 socket file by its associated numeric dot-form address, use:

              lsof -i@128.210.15.17

       To find an IP version 6 socket file (when the UNIX dialect supports IPv6) by its associated numeric colon-form address, use:

              lsof -i@[0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7]

       To  find  an  IP version 6 socket file (when the UNIX dialect supports IPv6) by an associated numeric colon-form address that
       has a run of zeroes in it - e.g., the loop-back address - use:

              lsof -i@[::1]

       To obtain a repeat mode marker line that contains the current time, use:

              lsof -rm====%T====

       To add spaces to the previous marker line, use:

              lsof -r "m==== %T ===="
